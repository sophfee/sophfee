# Hey! I'm Nick
Welcome to my profile!

## I like to program!
I'm a full stack developer! I've been programming since I was 13 years old, with my first language being LUA for Valve's *Half-life: Alyx*. I am now 16 years old and aspire to be a full time software engineer. I am entirely self-taught and dedicated many many hours to building my knowledge on the subject.
